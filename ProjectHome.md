The ScreenAntics project's goal is to make a rewrite of the engine behind the Johnny Castaway (Screen Antics) screensaver, which is a free and very aged one-of-a-kind screensaver by Sierra Online. The original was written for windows 3.x and can no longer run under the latest versions of Windows without a lot of trickery and sub-optimal conditions. The application does not work on 64-bit Windowe. The goal of this project is:
1. Decipher the resource files
2. Rebuild an engine that can read and run the resource files as the original screen saver.
3. Release the screen saver for several platforms, including Windows, Linux and smartphones.
